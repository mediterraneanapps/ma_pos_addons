==========================================
 Print certain products on Order Printers
==========================================

By default, you can assign only product categories to be printed on order printers and it is not convenient in some cases, e.g. if you want to print some products on one printer and other products of the same category on another one.

The module eliminates this disadvantage and allows to specify certain products, which should be printed on order printers. Note that in this case the product categories are not required to be given.
